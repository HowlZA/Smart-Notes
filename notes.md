# ISA 720 (Revised): The Auditor’s Responsibilities Relating to Other Information

## Objective
To clarify the auditor's responsibilities in relation to “other information” in documents containing audited financial statements and the auditor’s report.

## Definitions
- **Other Information**: Financial or non-financial information (excluding financial statements and auditor’s report) included in an entity’s annual report.
- **Annual Report**: A document issued by the entity containing audited financial statements, auditor’s report, and other information.
- **Misstatement of Other Information**: Information inconsistent with audited FS or auditor's knowledge, or otherwise misleading.

## Auditor’s Responsibilities
- **Read and Consider**: Auditor must read and consider other information for material inconsistencies with:
  - Financial statements.
  - Auditor's knowledge obtained during audit.
- **Respond to Misstatements**:
  - If a material misstatement is identified, discuss with management and request correction.
  - If uncorrected, communicate with those charged with governance.
  - Consider implications for the auditor's report and legal obligations.

## Timing of the Work
- Apply procedures to all other information obtained prior to the date of the auditor’s report.
- If received after auditor’s report, respond appropriately if misstatements are identified.

## Reporting
- Auditor must include a separate section titled **“Other Information”** in the auditor’s report:
  - Identify other information obtained.
  - State whether the auditor has anything to report.
  - Describe responsibilities for other information.

## Documentation
- Document procedures performed and conclusions reached regarding other information.
- If a material misstatement remains uncorrected, document steps taken and communications made.

## Application Guidance Highlights
- Applies to listed and unlisted entities.
- Examples of other information include management discussion and analysis, summaries of financial highlights, etc.
- Materiality relates to decisions made by users of financial statements.

## Summary of Key Changes (Revised ISA 720)
- Enhanced auditor’s work effort and reporting on other information.
- Clearer distinctions between responsibilities before and after auditor’s report date.
- Required communication and documentation standards expanded.
